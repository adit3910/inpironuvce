          <h2>Round 1</h2>
          <p>
            Brief introduction about NFT and how to design NFT will be
            explained. Then a topic for NFTs will be assigned. Based on the
            theme, each team should create as many NFT's as possible within 1
            hour.. The participants should bring their own laptops (each team at
            least 1)
          </p>

          <h2>Round 2</h2>
          <p>
            (This round will be conducted if there are more than 10 teams
            participating): Each team will be given a chance to present their
            NFT's to the judges. Then the participants will be scrutinized and
            selected for the final round based on their uniqueness and
            creativity.
          </p>

          <br />

        <div class="round">
          <h2>Round 3</h2>
          <p>
            Here the participants should set a price to their NFT’s and exchange
            their NFTs for any utilities/money within the campus in 1 hour.
          </p>

        <div class="round" style="text-align: left">
          <b>☆ Rules- <br /></b>
          <br />
          <p>
            1. Any utility or money exchanged for the NFT will not be
            returned.<br />
            <br />
            2. 1 NFT equals only 1 utility (Ex: For one NFT only one pen or one
            book can be exchanged. Two NFTs cannot be exchanged for one book or
            one utility) <br />
            <br />
            3. When money is exchanged for the NFT, then the maximum amount
            should be the price set in the 1st round. (Ex: A person sets ₹60 for
            an NFT, then the money exchanged can either be ₹60 or less not more
            than ₹60)
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Each team will be given a Slip. When NFT is exchanged, the
            participants have to take the sign of buyer and the buyer should
            write the price he/she bought the NFT for. <br />
            <br />
            5. There will be 3 anonymous buyers set by us in the campus who will
            have a unique currency of high value. They are hard to bargain, the
            participants can make use of this to increase their chance of
            winning. This currency will have a value that is equal to the
            highest price of an NFT in the entire competition. (Eg: If a team
            sets ₹500 for an NFT which is the highest compared to any other NFT
            prices in the competition, then the unique currency will have a
            value of ₹500)
            <br />
            <br />
            6. Point system is used for determining the winner. <br />
            ₹10 is 1 point, common utilities like books, stationary get 5-10
            points depending on the condition or quality. Eg: If participants
            exchange used or engineering books, then they will get 5 points
            only. For any other unique utilities like rare goodies won in
            competition, gift items, novels etc, points will be given based on
            the amount written on the Slip by the buyer. (Eg: If NFT is
            exchanged for a unique puzzle piece for ₹100. Then the points gained
            is 10 points. Note - the amount traded should be written by the
            buyer on slip)
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Winner will be declared based on the highest number of points and
            also the least difference between the quoted value and selling
            price.
